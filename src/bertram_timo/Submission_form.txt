Team name:
- Zischel

Description:
- Our Zischelbot utilises a Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search algorithm.
The basic MCTS algorithm was changed slightly in order to better fit the targeted domain.
Namely, the rollout section of the algorithm was adjusted to play the game until either player reaches the apple or dies.
Additionally, some slight adjustments were made in order to be able to model the simultaneous game with turn-based game trees.
